                <p class="article-text">The "string theory" in theoretical physics (later developed as "M theory") believes that all elementary particles can be [expressed] as special [waves] in a special space (ten-dimensional) (called "strings") , "String" is represented by the more essential "membrane" in M theory). Therefore, it is based on eleven-dimensional space-time (ten-dimensional space plus one-dimensional time).</p>
                <p class="article-text">"People are very fortunate to discover a new kind of symmetry.... One way is to say that time and space have additional dimensions besides the dimensions we experience. These dimensions are called Glassman dimensions because they are used The number of the so-called Grassmann variable is not measured by the usual real numbers.... For a positivist like me, the question of'do extra dimensions really exist?' is meaningless. People can only ask at most : Can a mathematical model with extra dimensions describe the universe well?" -Stephen Hawking, "The Universe in a Nutshell"</p>
