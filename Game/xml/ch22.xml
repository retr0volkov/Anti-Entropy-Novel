                <p class="article-text">This is the history of the real world.</p>
                <p class="article-text">In late 1875, Thomas Edison (1847 ~ 1931) moved his home to "Monroe Park" in Raritan Town. Here, from the opening of the laboratory in 1876 to the move out of the factory in 1887, Edison developed more than 400 inventions and applied for more than 1,000 patents in 11 years.</p>
                <p class="article-text">In 1925, the state of New Jersey honored Edison by erecting the "Thomas Edison Memorial" at the Site of Monroe Park, where Edison's home and laboratory had collapsed due to disuse.</p>
                <p class="article-text">In 1954, the town of Raritan was renamed "Edison City" to further honor Edison.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Today, Edison is one of the most livable towns in the world.</p>
