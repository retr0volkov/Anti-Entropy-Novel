                <p class="article-text-h">Note: </p>
                <p class="article-text">“Danny Boy” is a folk song written by English composer Frederic Weatherly. It is usually sung in tune to “Londonderry Air”. There have always been different theories about the meaning of this song, such as the fact that it is a love song, or an elegy, or a verse written by a father to a son departing for war, etc. </p>
