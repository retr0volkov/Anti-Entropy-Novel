                <p class="article-text-h">Note:</p>
                <p class="article-text">The Imperial Institute is located in Kensington, London. It was founded by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in 1888 and became one of the founding members of Imperial College, London in 1907. (Translator's note: This is not accurate: the Imperial Institute remained a separate institution from Imperial College, although the College now occupies the spot where the Institute once stood.)</p>
                <p class="article-text">In 1958, the Imperial Institute was renamed the Commonwealth Institute and the campus was rebuilt elsewhere. Of the original building, only the iconic Queen's Tower was retained.</p>

            <text>Having been “driven out of the house” by that violent redhaired girl, the pitiful young man now wanders aimlessly around the college, a college with close to 70 years of history.</text>

                <p class="article-text">The Imperial Institute.</p>
                <p class="article-text">In this institution, there are not only low-rise detached buildings like Lab 42, but also several, tall towering buildings with mottled peeling walls.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Close by, the pastel-green dome of the Queen's Tower is covered with dust and rainwater trails, producing an inexpressibly ugly colour and lustre — it is as if, even on such an uncommonly clear day, it felt the need to mock and remind people of the irksome air pollution that occurs every other weekday.</p>
            </text>
            <text>Having been accustomed to the spotless environs of high-end research labs, the young man named Welt feels oddly comforted by what could be considered as the landmark equivalent of a washed-up celebrity.</text>
            <text>Although there is no personal freedom in the absolute sense — at least this “omnipresent and omnipotent” organisation has chosen to loosen up for a moment.</text>
            <text>Well, maybe.</text>
            <text>Autumn is slowly setting in, and the sun makes a futile attempt to imbue some warmth into the cooling windswept earth.</text>
            <text>Leaning on a marble railing beside a footpath, Welt vigorously pats his cheeks.</text>
            <text>Better think up something more positive.</text>
            <sound src="deep breath.mp3"/>
            <text>Take a deep breath —</text>
            <text>…</text>
            <text>— Look at how beautiful the world is.</text>
            <text article="1">
                <p class="article-text">To the north of the institute is a large expanse of lush and verdant woodland. They say it's the famous Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens — but that will probably be of no interest to that particular pair of lady geniuses.</p>
                <p class="article-text">For those elites in their ivory tower, I fear that the only method of relaxation that comes to mind is to lean against a garden bench, close one's eyes, and relax.</p>
                <p class="article-text">It's not creative enough. Even leaving Einstein aside, Tesla will definitely be bored out of her mind.</p>
            </text>

                <p class="article-text">I should take them somewhere else more interesting.</p>
                <p class="article-text">London should have no shortage of fun things to do — With this thought in mind, Welt decides to go to the library to try his luck, and see if there is any information available there.</p>
                <p class="article-text">— Of course, he cannot know that in the future, there will be something more convenient like the Internet.</p>

            <text>… No no no, no matter what, a researcher's room can never be of that décor. Indeed, their private laboratory appears to be on the same floor.</text>
