                <p class="article-text">Déjà vu is a French phrase that literally means “already seen”. It refers to a common physiological phenomenon where a person sees a scene for the first time in a conscious state, but feels like they have already seen the exact same situation a second time. </p>
                <p class="article-text">(Translator's note: the Chinese note further explains the etymology of the Chinese and English terms for the phenomenon —  In Chinese, the term is borrowed from the Japanese translation, which is generally translated as “repeated sensation” (既视感), using the same characters as the Japanese Kanji (既視感), or “hallucinatory memory” (幻觉记忆); in English, it is directly copied from the French déjà vu.)</p>
