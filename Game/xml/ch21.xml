            <speak chara="ottoShadowNoFace">The locals came up with a plan to preserve their precious ship——</speak>
            <speak chara="ottoShadowNoFace">Every year each part of the ship would be inspected, and if any part was rotten it would be rebuilt.</speak>
            <speak chara="ottoShadowNoFace">A few hundred years later a philosopher came to see the ship, and by then each part had been replaced at least once.</speak>
            <speak chara="ottoShadowNoFace">The philosopher was very saddened to hear that and asked the locals 「Is this still the original ship?」.</speak>
            <speak chara="ottoShadowNoFace">And the locals told him in a thoughtless manner——</speak>
            <speak chara="ottoShadowNoFace">「Philosopher, if you believe this ship is different, then when did it stop being the original?」</speak>
            <speak chara="ottoShadowNoFace">「As you must know, even during the great hero's voyage the ship had its parts replaced.」</speak>

                <p class="article-text">Carbolic acid, or phenol (chemical formula: PhOH), is the simplest phenolic organic substance; its dilute solution is the earliest disinfectant used in modern medicine. Phenol is an unsafe disinfectant. Its concentrated solution has a strong ability to penetrate and corrode the skin, and is highly toxic; in modern times, its main use is in chemical synthesis, such as the manufacture of aspirin and phenolic resin.</p>

                <p class="article-text">European sturgeon (scientific name: Huso huso) is a fish belonging to the genus Sturgeon family Sturgeon. Its common name is "European sturgeon". It is also called "Black Sea Stray" and "Caspian Sea Stray" because of its origin. The European sturgeon is one of the largest freshwater fish species in the world, and is also the largest and most precious species of sturgeon, with a body length of more than 8 meters and a weight of more than 1 ton. The caviar of the European catfish (especially produced in Astrakhan, the "mouth of the Volga River") has plump eggs, a smooth taste, and a long-lasting aftertaste. It is the most delicious and valuable variety of all caviar.</p>

                <p class="article-text">A silver bullet is a musket bullet made of silver. In European medieval folklore, silver products, such as silver knives, silver forks, etc., are the only weapons that can fight against werewolves, witches and other monsters. Therefore, in the extended meaning, "silver bullet" also means a powerful, once and for all, "all-purpose trump card" suitable for various occasions.</p>

It is named because it fires like a typewriter and is the iconic weapon of the Chicago gang in the 1930s. The outstanding close-range lethality of the Thompson series made it one of the most popular submachine guns in the world at that time-second only to the "Bobosha" series of the Soviet Union.</p>
