            <speak chara="karlNoFace">Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying,</speak>
            <speak chara="karlNoFace">And kneel and say an "Avé" there for me;</speak>
            <speak chara="karlNoFace">And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,</speak>
            <speak chara="karlNoFace">And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,</speak>
            <speak chara="karlNoFace">For you will bend and tell me that you love me,</speak>
            <speak chara="karlNoFace">and I shall sleep in peace until you come to me … </speak>
