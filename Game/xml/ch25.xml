                <p class="article-text-h">Note：</p>
                <p class="article-text">Naval Station Norfolk (Naval Station Norfolk) is a naval port of the US Navy in Norfolk, Virginia. It is the home port of the US "Atlantic Fleet" and the largest naval base in the world.</p>
            </remark>
            <text>According to the reports, the center of the pulse is New York city, and said pulse is very similar to a Houkai energy pulse.</text>
            <text>However, there was no time to be amazed or worried.According to the 「Urgent Inquiry List」, she has been assigned as the Chief Commander and must oversee all rescue operations.</text>
            <text>She was always planning to act in the shadows so all this did was to speed up the schedule. She has to do what she can to evacuate all potential people that could turn into Otto's hostages.</text>
            <text>——To confuse a potential hidden enemy, she used a double to pretend she had just left the base station and contacted her students as if the plan had just been put in motion now.</text>
            <text>Who could have guessed two conflicting opinions would lead to her becoming the commander of the strongest country in the world, albeit temporarily.</text>
            <text>For now, all non-combatants working in the base must evacuate. The most 「important guests」 should be coming here shortly.</text>
            <text>Looking at the results alone, seems she was very lucky—— This is a very large country after all.</text>
            <text>No matter the disaster, people will be able to find a place that isn't affected by it.</text>
