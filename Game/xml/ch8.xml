                <p class="article-text-h">Note: </p>
                <p class="article-text">Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an encryption technology that is quite common today. </p>
                <p class="article-text">The elliptic curve here refers to an algebraic curve of the shape y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, not an ellipse in a conical curve. The elliptic curve is called an “elliptic curve” because a formula of the form x^3 + ax + b will appear in the process of integral calculation of the elliptic arc length; and it is also related to the reason why the elliptic arc length cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Elliptic curves are also a key springboard to prove Fermat's Last Theorem — its importance in algebra is evident.</p>
                <p class="article-text"> ECC is more difficult to crack than another common encryption technology, RSA (factorisation cipher).  For example, the minimum key length recommended by the National Bureau of Standards and Technology is 160 bits for ECC and 1024 bits for RSA. </p>
