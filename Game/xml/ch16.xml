            <text>Once again, no dreams today.</text>
            <text>That was some good quality sleep.</text>
            <text>The early morning air brings with it a briny scent, characteristic of the seaside.</text>
            <text>A quilt, soaked in moisture, rigidly covers my body.</text>
            <text>Behind the curtains shines the square-shaped light of the windows.</text>
            <text>It is indeed a new day.</text>
            <text>We will pack our luggage, and drive back to London. The results of Ada's deciphering work should be waiting for us.</text>
            <text> … But I have a strange sense of foreboding.</text>
            <text>I keep feeling that the fates of myself and the people around me will soon undergo a great change.</text>
            <text>That is something I had once avoided confronting.</text>
            <text>At one time, under the excuse of “shelving theories”, I had refused to think any further.</text>
            <text> … I'm actually not all that fond of London.</text>
            <text>I just feel that, living under the same roof, we have all gotten used to each other's presence.</text>
            <text>Even Welt seems like he has always been there with us.</text>
            <text>I hope, from the bottom of my heart, that this peace will last forever.</text>

            <text>Yet, military organisations such as Schicksal are prone to trampling over everything besides the right to life.</text>
            <text>In life and death situations, this is indeed something that cannot be helped.</text>
            <text>But, unilaterally pursuing a single kind of right will, in many cases, also tarnish that right itself.</text>

            <text> — Then it will gradually become the same abhorrent existence as the enemies it once destroyed.</text>
            <text>This is regardless of its leader, whether they be a political and military mastermind such as George III or Napoleon I, or a befuddled incompetent fool like Charles I or Louis XVI.</text>
