                <p class="article-text">There was a hero of the Athenians named Theseus. He was so great that the locals consecrated the ship he sailed as a monument.</p>
                <p class="article-text">But time is merciless, and the wood from which the ship was made gradually decayed. So that the great ship would not end up being burned as a sacrifice, they came up with a good idea: every few years, all the parts of the ship should be inspected, and if any were rotten, they would be replaced with new ones.</p>
                <p class="article-text">So, many years later, when a philosopher came to visit, all the parts on the ship had been replaced at least twice.</p>
                <p class="article-text">When the philosopher heard of this, he was very upset. He asked the local people, "Is this still the same ship?”</p>
                <p class="article-text">The locals replied nonchalantly: "If you say no, Mr. Philosopher, when do you think it started not to be? You have to know that even when going out to sea, ships need to replace parts from time to time.”</p>

            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">The former Empire State Building—— Now known as Welt Obelisk.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">Now I truly feel like Manhattan is back.</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">Welt Obelisk is the result of the skyscraper restoration project by ME Company. The design follows the 1930 version of the Empire State Building to the letter.</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">General Mechatronics went through rough times after the 「Thanksgiving Disaster」, but now reborn as ME Company they've become one of the Fortune 500 companies in the world.</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">As both a New York citizen and a ME Company employee, this must not have been easy for him. What he is feeling surely cannot be encapsulated by a slogan like "build back better".</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">At the time I was just an electrician in charge of the building's security.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">When at around 3-4 o'clock, the security guard on duty suddenly started banging on my door.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">I was sleeping and he dragged me out to the street in my pajamas.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">That's when I realized the city's electric network wasn't working.</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">In those chaotic and perilous twilit hours, people like John Smith inspected every corner of the building to eliminate any potential hazards.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">We just followed procedures, really. In situations like that, it's impossible for your brain to figure out what to do, so the only thing we could do was to follow existing disaster management procedures.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">But I gotta give thanks to everyone who was in the building, they respected our instructions and evacuated the building without panicking.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">Otherwise it would had been impossible for the building to collapse and still have 「zero casualties」.</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">As everyone knows, the Empire State Building was hit by a sudden meteorite at exactly 12:55pm and collapsed one hour later.</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">According to the expert calculations, most of the meteorites from the 「Thanksgiving Disaster」 burnt up at altitudes of more than 300 metres——</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">So besides the meteorite that fell into Raritan Bay, this is the only building in New York that was directly damaged.</speak>
