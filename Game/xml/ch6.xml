                <p class="article-text">In probability theory, if the probability of an event is 0, it is called a “zero-probability” event, which means that the event “almost certainly does not happen”.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Since in an infinite set, the probability of an event depends on its measurement in the sample space, there are indeed “possible” but “almost certainly improbable” events. For example — “take any number from all real numbers, and the number is rational”.</p> <!-- Schrödinger is trying to argue in a roundabout way that the world is full of coincidences - even people who are walking about today are the result of low-probability events - so this clue also being a coincidence is really not that surprising. -->
