                <p class="article-text">There are many equivalent expressions of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Common examples are: </p>
                <p class="article-text">“Heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring at the same time.” (Clausius); </p>
                <p class="article-text">“It is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.” (Kelvin); </p>
                <p class="article-text">“It is impossible to construct an engine which will work in a complete cycle, and produce no effect except the raising of a weight and cooling of a heat reservoir.” (Planck);</p>
                <p class="article-text"> “When an isolated system performs a process after the removal of a series of internal constraints, it will reach a unique state of equilibrium: this state of equilibrium is independent of the order in which the constraints are removed.” (Hatsopoulos-Keenan);</p>

Graves that had only been recently used several months ago were being reused to bury more dead. Highgate Cemetery was one of the new cemeteries planned by the British government at the time, to solve this challenging problem affecting the populace's dignity and welfare. </p>

                <p class="article-text">Pandu was the ancestor of the Pandavas in the Hindu epic “Mahabharata”, and the nominal father of the “five sons of Pandu”, who included Arjuna among others. </p>
                <p class="article-text">When he was young, Pandu hunted in the countryside, and shot arrows at a mating antelope — but the antelope happened to be the incarnation of a sage, and Pandu was cursed by him to not be able to approach others with the intention of lovemaking, or else he would die tragically.   When he grew up, as a king, he married Kunti, who had learned immortality. Kunti gave birth to sons (including Karna, the son of the Sun god, who was born before her marriage. This eldest son was adopted and brought up by a charioteer), thus giving Pandu heirs. (Translator's note: This is not entirely accurate as far as the most common version of the Mahabharata is concerned — Pandu had already married before he shot the sage and became cursed; Pandu thus exiled himself and his family from his own kingdom because of this curse [hence Tesla's nickname for the cat]; Kunti never learned of immortality; and precisely because of Pandu's curse, all her sons were sired by different fathers, who were all Hindu Gods.) </p>
