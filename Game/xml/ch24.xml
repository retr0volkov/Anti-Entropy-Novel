                <p class="article-text-h">Note：</p>
                <p class="article-text">Analog signal refers to a signal whose mathematical form is a continuous function in the time domain. Corresponding to the analog signal is a digital signal, which only takes the binary opposite logic value.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Compared with digital signals, analog signals are mainly used to record original information (such as audio, video, etc.), or measurement values with a continuously varying range (such as temperature, pressure, displacement, etc.). Its disadvantage is that it cannot resist the influence of channel noise, and it will gradually become distorted after multiple copies or long-distance transmission.</p>
