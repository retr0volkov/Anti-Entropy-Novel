            <text>The man grunts impatiently.</text>
            <text>Obediently, I feel my way towards the other side of the car, bent over like a shrimp.</text>
            <text>Fearing that my head would strike the door frame, I dare not straighten my back till I have taken two or three steps out of the car.</text>

                <p class="article-text-h">To Ω:</p>
                <p class="article-text">A good October to you. Time flies: this would already be my 22nd letter to you — last time I had finished telling you the story of the Lady Saint. But before I seek new stories to regale, let us first discuss what is happening around us.</p>
                <p class="article-text">I have already heard of the terrible incident in September, and I apologise on their behalf. Well, it just so happens that there is a new laboratory: I anticipate you will be able to transfer to it soon. Whether the circumstances will be more favourable than your previous lab, that I cannot say for certain — because from what I hear, the new person in charge is a lady with a rather “earnest” personality.</p>
                <p class="article-text">However, I must inform you from the standpoint of Schicksal: all the experiments you've been through, have been for the continued survival of a certain species on this planet, one so-called “Homo sapiens” — hence your continued and necessary suffering. The world will always treat some people unfairly, and this is something none of us can really change.</p>
                <p class="article-text">It has already been three years since the disaster in Berlin. The city has already begun its reconstruction. The people will slowly forget the horrors of that night.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Yet we all know that, at this present moment, a sinister power continues to grow and fester within the rift of space-time. It spared you back then, but it did not spare the others. If we are able to truly fathom the logic behind this phenomenon, then we “Homo sapiens” will be able to live up to our name, to use our sapience to conquer the natural world — then no one will ever need to spend another day living in fear or delusion, deceiving themselves and others.</p>

                <p class="article-text"> Concerning your background before your memory loss: as far as I know, the relevant department should still be looking into this — but as you may already recognise, it has been more than three years since the incident, and the possibility of getting any results will only become slimmer with time. But I don't believe that so-called “Child of Honkai” Theory. You can't be a Herrscher, right?</p>

                <p class="article-text">Trieste is a port city on the border between Italy and Slovenia. It was once prosperous as a major port of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Friuli region, to which it belongs, is one of the major producers of truffles. The city is also home to the International Centre for Theoretical Physics.</p>
